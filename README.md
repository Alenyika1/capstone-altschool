Overview:

A microservices-based architecture application is deployed on Kubernetes and there’s a need to create a clear IaaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy the services in a fast manner.

Setup Details:

Provision the Socks Shop example microservice application – https://microservices-demo.github.io/

Task Instructions:
